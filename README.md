# Save a life
This is a HTML5 Game that ran inside a Facebook tab for DARS's marketing campaign. The goal was to
raise awareness how to properly make way for an ambulance on the highway.

## Descripton
You, the player, have to move cars on the highway and make way for the ambulance to reach the crash
as quickly as possible. By clicking on vehicles on the highway to move them to the left or the right side
of the road and with it make way for an ambulance to drive faster. Your clicking and cursor aiming abilities
come into effect. The quicker you are, the faster the ambulance will arrive to the car crash. Your time is
saved and compared on the leaderboard against other players on Facebook.

At the end you are asked to invite your Facebook friends to compete against your score.

## Technologies used:
- Silex (lightweight Symfony) PHP framework
- Pixi.JS for rendering
- RequireJS to "glue" all javascript components
- Facebook JavaScript & Facebook API
- JavaScript was compiles using Grunt
- CSS was compiled using CodeKit (don't ask me why I did it like that, it was quite some time ago :D)
